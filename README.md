# SwitchShard
This is a powershell script that allows the user to switch between the modded branch and vanilla branch for stoneshard. This was just a personal project that satisfied a niche requirement of mine. 

this script assumes your game is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common" - if not just find the path and edit it in the script.

How to use: 

step 1 - Download the vanilla version of the game from steam then rename name it to Stoneshard - vanilla (you must rename the file as steam only allows one instance of a game at a time).

step 2 - Download the modded branch version of the game from steam.

step 3 - If you wish to switch from the modded branch to vanilla run the script, the script will tell the user what version is currently running and prompt them if they like to change to the other version.

step 4 - enter 'Y' or 'y' press enter and you will switch the version of the game.


WARNING whatever is your native branch and the branch you currently active will be altered upon update.
